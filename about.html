    <div class="about-container">

        (Strongly) Bonded by a history of experimental science and everyday labwork, Authoritarian Brewery and Anarchy Brewery (no relation to 
        <a href="https://anarchybrewco.com/" title="Anarchy Brew Co." target="_blank">Anarchy Brew Co.</a>) originated with two mass spectrometrists
        with a thirst for refreshment and adventure when they came together to produce their first beer in September 2016.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p class="about-paragraphs">
        Test one, so named as a nod to <a href="https://warp.net/" title="Warp Records" target="_blank">Warp Records</a>, was the inaugural brew of ABAB, 
        and springboarded the intrepid pair to experimenting with fruit beers, Lambic-stylings, and a range of malts.  Check out our <strong>back catalogue</strong> 
        (coming soon) to follow ABAB's journey since then.  
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p class="about-paragraphs">
        Lovingly created in an unassuming residential kitchen in Chorlton-cum-Hardy, in south Manchester, ABAB's brews have gone on to be the toast of the neighbourhood,
        encompassing Christmas brews, celebration brews, and regular favourites. ABAB can still be found cooking up ideas for their latest creations, attempting to perfect
        the one that <em>always</em> seems to elude us (I'm looking at you, <strong>pizzly beer</strong>).  And on a brew day, they'll be found festidiously cleaning out the
        recyled bottles that make up the bulk of the brewery assets (by weight, anyway).  Ensuring that hundreds of bottles are re-used on site dramatically reduces the carbon
         footprint of our beers, and gives us a warm glow that matches what we feel after a couple of Magnum P.I.s (honestly, go see that <strong>back catalogue</strong>).
    </p>

    <p class="about-paragraphs">While making homebrew may not be for everyone, if you know us, you know how much we enjoy what we do.  If you don't know us and you're interested in our recipies and
        tales of battles lost and won, just <a href="#" target="_blank"> drop us a line</a>.
